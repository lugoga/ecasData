    "text": "This year’s report covers the years 2010 to 2020 and provide descriptive statistics for the following categories; artisanal fisheries total landings; artisanal catch rates; artisanal fisheries catch weight, number of fishing caught, number of fishers, catch rates and price trends. The report also provides management highlights for each district that include summary of stock status, updates on catch rates; trend of total landings; and other management schemes in the area like existance of collaborative fisheries management areas.\nInformation in this report came from several sources. Artisanal landings, revenue, and prive data were primarily obtained from the Fisheries Statistics Division, Office of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. Records from the ministry encompass catch records of analog data storage system called Catch Assessment Survey (CAS); electronic Catch Assement Survey (e-CAS) and frame surveys obtained from the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Fisheries Division. We also obtained catch related data of the Mafia Island from the Mafia Island Marine Protected Areas. Spatial data that illustrate the locations of collaborative fisheries management areas (CFMA) were obtained from WWF-Tanzania. Critical coastal habitats like mangroves, seagrass and coral reefs spatial datasets were collected from the archives of the Institute of Marine Sciences.\nThe purpose of this assignment is to provide a resource that will help fisheries managers and decision makers in the coastal and marine waters of Tanzania to quickly identify potential and sustainable coastal areas for fisheries. The report was developed so that it can be easily used by anyone involved in fisheries and coastal resource management, regardless of the water body or project scope. This report explains:\n\nThe state of the e-CAS database\nHow the data included in the report was gathered and analysed\nHow the indicators were selected and parameters computed\nHow to use the report\n\nThe report also include case studies that illustrate some of the collaborative fisheries management areas that clearly indicate fishing good practises for sustainable resources use.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMany people particpated in the production of this report. Fisheries Officer,\nSeveral institutes supported us during the process of gathering data, data analysis and report of findings. Some of these institute include BMU, MIMP, WWF, IMS, TAFIRI, SOAF, MPRU\nThe report’s design and layout was done by Masumbuko Semba and Nyamisi Peter.\nAddress all comments and questions to:\nWWF–Tanzania, Marine Program Manene Stree, P.Box xxxx phone +255 717603703\nmtu@gmail.com"

    "text": "The authority to manage coastal and marine fisheries in Tanzania is legally under the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. The marine fisheries in Tanzania is dominated by small scale artisanal fisheries that constitute more than 90 percent of the total landed weights. The Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) is the public institute with delegated authority from the ministry to conduct research of fisheries and related field in the freshwater and marine waters of Tanzania. The fisheries of Tanzania are generally defined as fishing activities that take place in the United Republic of territorial and Exclusive Economic Zones—up to 200 nautical miles from it’s coastline. WWF-Tanzania is actively collaborating with public agencies to ensure fisheries resources are utilized and sustained for future generations.\nIn 2018, TAFIRI in collaboration with WWF conducted a pilot study to explore the use of the mobile application as a tool in fisheries data collection (Sailale & Mpuruti, 2021). The initiative started with five selected villages and members from village’s BMU were trained to use an application to record fisheries data in the electronic Catch Assessment Survey (e-CAS). Through this initiative several species of tuna and tuna-like were recorded for the first time (Kuguru and Sailale, 2018). Following the benefits of the e-CAS, the Government of Tanzania adopted the platform and endorsed as tool for fisheries data collection both in coastal and marine waters. Later, the East African Community (EAC) through Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO) Secretariat approved the use of e–CAS to collect and manage fisheries resources in the area.\nToday, amount of fisheries data that exists in the e–CAS are enough to assist scientist to evaluate and explore the fisheries dynamics in both coastal and freshwater ecosystems. Recognizing the archived fisheries data, early 2019 WWF TCO/WWF UK requested TAFIRI to assess fisheries performance in coastal areas that receive WWF’s support and compare the findings with coastal areas without WWF’s support. Early 2020, WWF TCO through the support of Blue Action Fund (BAF) commissioned a consultancy work to TAFIRI to extend the analysis and of fisheries in the e-CAS that was collected between 2017 and 2020.\nBAF aims to strengthen small scale fisheries management of three priority groups—octopus, small pelagic and prawn in the Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa seascape. Given the size of the area, BAF strategically chose ten collaborative fisheries managed areas (CFMAs) that bring together 42 villages that intersect with the proposed Man and Biosphere Reserve. BAF focus on monitoring fisheries resources in the area and ensure sustainable utilization of fisheries and its related resources. The project prime goal is to determine biological and exploitation fisheries reference points that can be used as indicators to gauge the state of fisheries in the area.\nThough the e–CAS has archieved a substantial amount of artisal fish records, however, these data are fishery dependent and lack important measurements like total length and weight along with maturity stage of individual fish. These three measurements are key to assess the stock of data poor fishery like those in the Kibiti, Mafia, and Kilwa Seascape. With additional data collected through SWIOFISH project, the data in e–CAS can suffice to assess the stock of some species and serve as reference points for fisheries exploitation in the future."

Fish catch (or simply catch) refers to catches of fishery products including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, residues and aquatic plants, that are taken at from the fishing ground in specified time.\nCatch rate has been defined as differently by several institutes and individuals. Because each fisheries officer, goverment agency and non-goverment organizations will have different definitions or criteria for determining what they consider as catch rates based on the available data and the type of fishery, the research team has taken a broader approach to identify catch rates.\nThe essence of catch rates is to standardized the landed weight. Standardization is essential, in any observational dataset, to allow undistorted comparisons of rates over time or over different areas. In fisheries, commercial catch rates are often standardized for use as an index of relative abundance, particularly in fisheries where a regular resource survey has not been feasible (Hilborn and Walters, 1992; Maunder and Punt, 2004).\nTo be useful as an index of relative abundance, raw catch per unit effort (cpue) must be standardized for changes or variations in catchability, or changes in cpue that are attributable to variable catchability may be incorrectly concluded to be due to changes in abundance."

The ecological functioning of this seascape provide food, income and tourism industry (Tumbo et al., 2015).This seascape is the most biologically productive and diverse marine area in Tanzania and East Africa. According to Oglethorpe (n.d.), this seascape cover about 25 percent of the Tanzanian mainland’s nearshore waters and supports a myriad of marine fish catches. About 26 percent of coral reef habitats is found in this seascape and and a largest mangrove cover (See Figure 3.2) in the Western Indian Ocean Region.\nThe change of these monsoon winds have strong influence on the oceanographic conditions and weather patterns in the area thus also affects marine fisheries ecology and production. Furthermore, the discharge of Rufiji River into the area has continuously mix salt water the freshwater from mainland and creates a unique and largest estuary in the region. Together with The presence of critical coastal habitats—mangroves, seagrass and coral reefs in the Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa seascape serve as nursery and feeding grounds thus make it one of the most productive coastal area in Tanzania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: A map of the Mafia Channel.

    "text": "3.5 Landing sites\nThe 2018 frame survey reported more than 250 landing sites are found along the coastline of Tanzania’s mainland (Sailale & Mpuruti, 2021). About 106 of these landing sites record the fish catch and related information into the electronic catch assessment survey (e–CAS) platform. Seventy nine of these landing sites are found in coastal waters of Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa with more than 75 percent engaged in data entry of daily fish catches into the e–CAS (Sailale & Mpuruti, 2021).\n\n3.5.1 Catch and Effort Data\nCatch assessment and frame surveys are the techniques widely used to collect fisheries catch and effort information. The Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MLF) of Tanzania mainland has been collecting both catch and effort data for decades using conventional method. However, Sailale & Mpuruti (2021) reported that the ministry adopted an electronic data collection system in 2016 to collect and store fisheries data.\nThe ministry has been collecting catch information that is used to assess the stock status of marine fisheries in a modern technique since 2017 (Sailale & Mpuruti, 2021). According to Sailale and Mpuruti (2021), the electronic catch assessment survey (eCAS), which replaced manual data collection (CAS), has revolutionized data collection, storage and retrieval of fisheries in Tanzania mainland. The eCAS system provide real-time fisheries data of 106 landing sites along seventeen coastal districts of Tanzania since July 2017 up to date. The system records almost ten days information of catches data that a spread in a month (Sailale & Mpuruti, 2021). The ministry selected enumerators from representative landing sites, who records catches landed at the landing sites and enter the recorded information into the eCAS system using mobile phones. The catch fishery data at the landing sites include;\n\nadministrative information — name of the landing site, village and district.\nthe geographical information(longitude and latitude) and time stemp of data entry\nfishing grounds and collaborative fisheries management areas (CFMA)\ntype of vessels and its mode of propulsion\ntype, size and number of gears\nnumber of fishers in a vessel\nthe departure and return time of fishing\nweight and number of individual species landed\nactive fishing days\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Collaborative fisheries management areas\nThe geometry polygon shapefiles of collaborative fisheries management areas(CFMA) within the RUMAKI seascape will be gathered from the WWF-Tanzania Office. These spatial data contain the boundary of the CFMA along with the corresponding name of each CFMA.\n\n\n3.5.3 Mafia Island Marine Park\nThe Mafia Island Marine Park (MIMP) collects fishery dependent catch and effort data of the landing sites that fall within the park. The initiatives have been collecting catch and economic data of several species since 2010. The data include……\n\n\n3.5.4 Frame Survey\nThe second dataset of fisheries that provide effort information at selected landing sites comes from frame surveys. Although the ministry have conducted a biannual frame survey for sometime, only a database of frame surveys for 2016 and 2018 are available in digital forms. Effort information for previous years will be extracted from annual fisheries reports.\n\n\n3.5.5 Fishing Grounds\nThe areas in water that fishers go fishing are called fishing grounds and these are important in fisheries. Knowing the geographical position (longitude and latitude) of fishing grounds help management of fisheries, because they provide critical information where fishers prefer to harvest the resources. Recognizing the importance of the geographical positions, TAFIRI established a participatory approach in which fishers record and mark the positions of daily fishing events at particular fishing ground. Although these information is available for all coastal districts of Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar, it only provide a snapshot of common fishing grounds because it was focused for ringnet fishery and covered six months period of data collection. In this work, we will use these information to supplement CFMAs fishing grounds."

Depending on the location of the landing site, they were intersected with the collaborative fisheries management areas (CFMAs). Those that fall within the CFMAs were grouped into management scheme and those outside the CFMAs as non-management scheme.\n\n\n3.6.2 Seasonality\nTo assess the effect of monsoon seasons, fisheries, satellites and meteorological data will be categorized into two monsoon seasons. Data with time stamp from May to October wlll be placed in the Southeast monsoon season (SEM) and records that are within a period from November to April will be placed into the northeast monsoon season (NEM)\n\n\n3.6.3 Priority fisheries\nFish were grouped into three major priority fishery groups. These groups are prawn, octopus and small pelagics.\n\n\n3.6.4 Catch rate (Catch Per Unit Effort)\nTo reduce variation in weight of landed catches at each geographical location of harvestable areas, the e–CAS fisheries catch data were standardized and catch rates defined as catch per unit effort (CPUE) was derived. This was particularly important for further analysis of assessing fish stock healthiness. Catch rate of individual reported landing was obtained by dividing the total weight obtained in a catch of each fishing trip by number of fishers in a vessel and obtain CPUE in units of kilograms per fishers as outlined in equation @ref(eq:cpue1).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{CPUE} = \\frac{\\sum_{n = \\infty}^{\\infty} W_{i}^j}{N_{i}^j} (\\#eq:cpue1)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(W\\) is the weight in kilogram and \\(N\\) is the number of fishers in a vessel at that fished at geographical location \\(i\\) from a particular vessels \\(j\\)\n\n\n3.6.5 Spatial Feature of fishing grounds\nSince e–CAS catch data lack geographical positions of fishing grounds, these information will be extracted from ringnet data, which contain geographical information of fishing grounds along the coastal waters of mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar.Once the spatial information is obtained, will be joined with e–Cas data using common variable— fishing ground name."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most basic issues that is important for fisheries management is the understanding of the the distribution of key indicators and whether they change both in space and time. The common approach that is widely used in fisheries management is taking statistics at the receiving hand—landing sites. The central problem is that doing that only provide reference of the catch at the receiving hand—landing sites and ignore the source of fishery resource—fishing grounds. In this chapter we discuss catch rates, income and fishing effort at the collaborative fisheries managed areas (CFMA) and compare how they vary both in space and time.\nThe Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa seascape (Figure 4.1) is a unique coastal areas because of myriad coastal habitats like magroves, seagrass and coral reefs, discharge of Rufiji River that form the largest estuary in the region, the change of speed and direction of trade winds that form monsoon winds, and the bathing of the East African Coastal Current that mix the water continuously."

    "text": "4.1 e-CAS\n\n4.1.1 Fishery Data Available\n\n\n\nThe electronic catch assessment survey (e-CAS) system trial data collection begun in 2017 and until the end of 2020, recorded 5504 information of different marine fish species. Most of these information were recorded in the Kilwa district (3613), followed by Mafia (1629) and Kibit district has the lowest number of 262 in the e-CAS platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      district\n      Elasmobranch\n      Octopus\n      Others\n      Prawn\n      Reef Fish\n      Small Pelagic\n      Tuna\n      Total\n    \n  \n  \n    Kibiti\n5\n0\n144\n45\n16\n52\n0\n262\n    Kilwa\n146\n11\n71\n0\n2701\n624\n60\n3613\n    Mafia\n61\n355\n192\n0\n720\n206\n95\n1629\n    Total\n212\n366\n407\n45\n3437\n882\n155\n5504\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe records in the e-CAS vary not only by the priority fishery but also for the collaborative fisheries managed areas (CFMAs). For instance, Figure 4.2 illustrated the reef fishery records constitute more than 62 percent and most of these records are from the Nyamanjisopoja CFMA. The small pelagic fishery constitute about 16 percent of the total records and like reef fish, most records are from Nyamanjisopoja CFMA (Figure 4.2). Other priority fishery are distributed across CFMAs at small proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: The percentage composition of priority fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\nThough octopus and prawns are among important fisheries in the area, but their records in the e-CAS are few. For instance, we found that Octopus fishery is most recorded at BK CFMA and no single value of octopus has been recorded in CFMAS like Nyamanjisopoja (Figure 4.3), which has the highest records of Reef and small pelagic fishery. The absent of octopus fishery in other CFMA suggest that records in the e-CAS is fishery priority specific.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: The percentage composition for octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: The percentage composition for octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fisheries governance framework in Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa seascape is centred around the establishment of collaborative fisheries management areas (CFMAs). CFMAs are jointly managed by neighbouring BMUs who share fishing grounds. Among many key objectives of CFMA include conducting fishing pattern surveys and identifying priority fisheries. A functioning CFMA usually has BMU Statistics Committee capable to collect and analyse fisheries data for internal decision making. They are familiar with types and uses of fisheries data and guided through the process of designing and reviewing a data collection protocol.\nReporting of fisheries data in the electronic catch assessment system often depend on the collaboration with beach management unit (BMU). The willingness of BMU in a particular CFMA is key for successful data entry. We found that data entry into the e-CAS system relate closely to the BMU operations and data vary accordingly. For instance, more than 88 percent of data in Kibiti recorded fished at Mchimchunya CFMA (Figure 4.5). Similar to Kibiti, in Mafia the records in Mafia was dominated with fish from BK CFMA (Figure 4.6) and Nyamanjisopoja recorded a stagerring 85% of records in the e–CAS (@(Figure 4.7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Collaborative fisheries man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Collaborative fisheries management areas in Mafia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Collaborative fisheries management areas in Kilwa\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Catch Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: The catch rates for octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: The spatial pattern of catch rates by CFMA for octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Income\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: The income of fishers in octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: The spatial pattern of income of fishers in octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Effort (Number of Active Fishers)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The fishing effort in octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: The fishing effort in octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: The spatial pattern of fishing effort in octopus, small pelagic and reef fishery by CFMAs based on the avaialble e-CAS dataset"

The harvesting business perspective is identified by fleets using comparable technologies and serving similar markets. The management perspective is identified by a common set of rules for access and harvest.\nFor sustainable fishery the three perspective must intersect. Several indicators are used to assess the sustainability of the fishery. In this chapter we discuss some indicators that we chose to assess the sustainability of priority fishery in the study area. Based on available data, catch rate, the composition of fished species and total fish production were chosen as metric to evaluate the health of the fishery in Kibiti, Mafia and Kilwa Seascape (Figure 6.2).\nSeveral achieved fisheries data from government, NGO and, academia and research institutes was used to evaluate the effectiveness of management systems and help answer what works. What works best for fisheries? What works best for economic returns, business and employment? What works best for the community?"

    "text": "A.1 Getting started\nR Markdown integrates code and natural language in a way that is called ‘literate programming’ (Knuth1984?). R Markdown is a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But, it means that we must use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like.\nR Markdown is a variant of Markdown that is specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included. One advantage is that we can get a ‘live’ document in which code executes and then forms part of the document. Another advantage of R Markdown is that very similar code can compile into a variety of documents, including html pages and PDFs. R Markdown also has default options set up for including a title, author, and date sections. One disadvantage is that it can take a while for a document to compile because all the code needs to run. (rmarkdownforscientists?) is especially useful for instructions on how to achieve specific outcomes with R Markdown.\nWe can create a new R Markdown document within RStudio (‘File’ -> ‘New File’ -> ‘R Markdown Document’)."

    "text": "A.3 R chunks\nWe can include code for R and many other languages in code chunks within an R Markdown document. Then when we knit the document, the code will run and be included in the document.\nTo create an R chunk, we start with three backticks and then within curly braces we tell R Markdown that this is an R chunk. Anything inside this chunk will be considered R code and run as such. For instance, we could load the tidyverse and AER and make a graph of the number of times a survey respondent visited the doctor in the past two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe output of that code is Figure @ref(fig:doctervisits).\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of illnesses in the past two weeks, based on the 1977–1978 Australian Health Survey\n\n\n\n\nThere are various evaluation options that are available in chunks. We include these by putting a comma after r and then specifying any options before the closing curly brace. Helpful options include:\n\necho = FALSE: run the code and include the output, but do not print the code in the document.\ninclude = FALSE: run the code but do not output anything and do not print the code in the document.\neval = FALSE: do not run the code, and hence do not include the outputs, but do print the code in the document.\nwarning = FALSE: do not display warnings.\nmessage = FALSE: do not display messages.\n\nFor instance, we could include the output, but not the code, and suppress any warnings.\n\n\n\nIt is important to leave a blank line on either side of an R chunk, otherwise it may not run properly.\n\n\n\nIt is also important that the R Markdown document itself loads any datasets that are needed. It is not enough that they are in the environment. This is because the R Markdown document evaluates the code in the document when it is built, not necessarily the environment."

    "section": "A.6 Cross-references",
    "text": "A.6 Cross-references\nIt can be useful to cross-reference figures, tables, and equations. This makes it easier to refer to them in the text. To do this for a figure we refer to the name of the R chunk that creates or contains the figure. For instance, (Figure \\@ref(fig:uniquename)) will produce: (Figure @ref(fig:uniquename)) as the name of the R chunk is uniquename. We also need to add ‘fig’ in front of the chunk name so that R Markdown knows that this is a figure. We then include a ‘fig.cap’ in the R chunk that specifies a caption.\n```{r uniquename, fig.cap = \"Number of illnesses in the past two weeks, based on the 1977--1978 Australian Health Survey\", echo = TRUE}\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\n\ndata(\"DoctorVisits\", package = \"AER\")\n\nDoctorVisits |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = illness)) +\n  geom_histogram(stat = \"count\")\n\n\n\n\nNumber of illnesses in the past two weeks, based on the 1977–1978 Australian Health Survey\n\n\n\n\nWe can take a similar, but slightly different, approach to cross-reference tables. For instance, (Table \\@ref(tab:docvisittable)) will produce: (Table A.1). In this case we specify ‘tab’ before the unique reference to the table, so that R Markdown knows that it is a table. For tables we need to include the caption in the main content, as a ‘caption’, rather than in a ‘fig.cap’ chunk option as is the case for figures.\n\n\n\n\nTable A.1: Number of visits to the doctor in the past two weeks, based on the 1977–1978 Australian Health Survey\n\n\nvisits\nn\n\n\n\n\n0\n4141\n\n\n1\n782\n\n\n2\n174\n\n\n3\n30\n\n\n4\n24\n\n\n5\n9\n\n\n6\n12\n\n\n7\n12\n\n\n8\n5\n\n\n9\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can also cross-reference equations. To that we need to add a tag (\\#eq:macroidentity) which we then reference. For instance, use Equation \\@ref(eq:macroidentity). to produce Equation @ref(eq:macroidentity).\n\\begin{equation}\nY = C + I + G + (X - M) (\\#eq:macroidentity)\n\\end{equation}\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nY = C + I + G + (X - M) (\\#eq:macroidentity)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhen using cross-references, it is important that the R chunks have simple labels. In general, try to keep the names simple but unique, and if possible, avoid punctuation and stick to letters. Do not use underbars in the labels because that will cause an error."
